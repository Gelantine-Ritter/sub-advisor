    <h1>For culture makers and culture curious</h1>
    <br />
    <p>sub advisor is a platform for cultural venues that want to promote their
    events as well as for all those curious to know what's going on outside or
    online since the pandemic.
    <br />
    <br />
    What's on today? What's new? Where can I experience something different? 
    <br />
    These are the questions that led us to mix types and genres of events on one place. 
    <br />
    <br />
    We believe that culture makers are as much important as cultural events. 
    sub advisor is not only an event calendar. We wanted to make it a place to discover the cultural places and artists too.
    <br />
    <br />
    That's why the sub advisor editorial team has chosen to set up a random pic that selects a random place to highlight. 
    So do smaller and lesser-known organisers have the opportunity to welcome new visitors and curious people to discover new places.
    <br />
    <br />
    Our project started in 2021 during the pandemic. Since the first lockdown, many events had to be cancelled or moved online. 
    Missing concerts, parties and cultural experiences has led us to use these constrained months to develop this platform and reconnect with the emotions that cultural places offer us.
